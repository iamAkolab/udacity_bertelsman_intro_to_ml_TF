## LESSON 1
* Machine Learning Bird's Eye View
Before diving into the many algorithms of machine learning, 
it is important to take a step back and understand the big picture associated with the entire field.

## LESSON 2
* Linear Regression
Linear regression is one of the most fundamental algorithms in machine learning. In this lesson, learn how linear regression works!


## LESSON 3
Perceptron Algorithm
The perceptron algorithm is an algorithm for classifying data. It is the building block of neural networks.
